# Autonomous-Industrial-Inspection-Surveillance-
This project develops an autonomous industrial inspection robot using ESP32 and Raspberry Pi. ESP32 manages real-time motor control and emergency safety, while Raspberry Pi handles camera and processing tasks. Crawl and walk modes improve safe navigation, making the system reliable, modular, and suitable for hazardous industrial environments
